# #### Urban Rural Classification
#
# We use the 2011 rural urban classification to match the SPC to the NTS. The NTS has 2 columns that we can use to match to the SPC: `Settlement2011EW_B03ID` and `Settlement2011EW_B04ID`. The `Settlement2011EW_B03ID` column is more general (urban / rural only), while the `Settlement2011EW_B04ID` column is more specific. We stick to the more general column for now.
